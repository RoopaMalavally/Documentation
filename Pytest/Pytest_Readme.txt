Why you picked this section

I chose the Installation and Getting Started guide for the following reasons:

- Installation is the inital setup and a basic requirement to deploy an application or a service into action. 
It is important we understand and adhere to the system and other requirements prior to deploying the application.

- The deployment guide documentation requires working with the development or QA teams to understand the 
recommended server configuration and seek clarifications, as needed.  

From a documentation best practice perspective, we must ensure the steps to install an application is 
documented accurately prior to providing the complexities of configuration and deployment of components.

How you improved this section

I have made the following changes to improve the content:

- Reformatted the Installation and Getting Started Guide
- Edited for language and grammar inaccuracies
- Restructured headings for parallelism
- Added and numbered steps for installing and running tests
- Provided accurate steps to create files 
- Ensured accuracy of naming conventions
- Added code snippets in table cell for readability 
- Removed redundant content
- Referred documentation about Python to understand concepts like assert and quiet mode (summarized reports) 
and verbose mode (detailed reports)

A 1-2 paragraph summary of the information in the section, assuming modest technical knowledge of the reader


The Installation and Getting Started Guide provides details about Python's testing framework called pytest.
This document discusses the system requirements and process for its implementation. It also highlights the 
merits of using pytest for testing purposes.

The following features make pytest easier to use:

- it requires only functions to write tests and not classes. Both simple and complex tests are created using functions.

- you can run multiple tests in the directory and its subdirections. pytest requires that the test files 
either begin with "test_" or end with "_test.py". This naming convention helps identify the test files
and they are run simultaneously. 

- pytest can group multiple test functions into classes. You can write a test to see how code should behave 
and see it fail. Developers can, then, correct the code until the test passes.  

- pytest enables to you create unique temporary directories. 

- pytest logs failed tests in red color. The color codes make for easy detection of errors.
